          <h2>A wild clue appears...but where does it lead?</h2>
          <br>
          
					So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br>
					Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<br>
<br>
<br>
					It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br>
					And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,<br>
					or even your year<br>
					but..<br>
<br>
<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					When the rain starts to pour<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					Like I've been there before<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					'Cuz you're there for me too...<br>
<br>
<br>
					You're still in bed at ten<br>
					And work began at eight<br>
					You've burned your breakfast<br>
					So far... things are goin' great<br>
<br>
<br>
					Your mother warned you there'd be days like these<br>
					Oh but she didn't tell you when the world has brought<br>
					You down to your knees that...<br>
<br>
<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					When the rain starts to pour<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					Like I've been there before<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					'Cuz you're there for me too...<br>
<br>
<br>
					No one could ever know me<br>
					No one could ever see me<br>
					Seems you're the only one who knows<br>
					What it's like to be me<br>
					Someone to face the day with<br>
					Make it through all the rest with<br>
					Someone I'll always laugh with<br>
					Even at my worst I'm best with you, yeah<br>
<br>
<br>
					It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br>
					And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,<br>
					or even your year...<br>
<br>
<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					When the rain starts to pour<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					Like I've been there before<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					'Cuz you're there for me too...<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					I'll be there for you<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					I'll be there for you<br>
					'Cuz you're there for me too...
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
